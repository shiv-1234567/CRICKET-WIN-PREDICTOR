# CRICKET-WIN-PREDICTOR

IN THIS REPO I HAVE CREATED A WEBAPP USING IPL DATASETS FROM KAGGLE USING WHICH I HAVE TRAINED MY LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL BALL BY BALL TO PREDICT THE CHANCES OF WINNING OF 2ND BATTINF/CHASING TEAM  USING LOGISTIC REGRESSION ATTRIBUTE PREDICT PROBABILITY WHICH PREDICT PROBABILITY OF WINNING AT EACH BALL THEN PROBABILITY IS CONVERTED TO PERCENTAGE AND DISPLAYED.
WE HAVE TO CHOOSE TEAM 1 AS BOWLING AND TEAM 2 FOR BATTING THEN PROVIDE TARGET FOR BATTING TEAM AND RUN SCORED AT THE TIME OF PREDICTION ALONG WITH WICKETS LEFT.
